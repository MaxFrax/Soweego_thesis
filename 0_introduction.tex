\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}
Most of the World Wide Web users probably had experience with Wikipedia for enhancing their knowledge, due to the easily accessible free information. However, its unstructured data does not enable straightforward machine processing. For this reason, projects like Wikidata were created. Wikidata acts as central storage for structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects, including Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wikisource, and others.\footnote{\url{https://www.wikidata.org/}}
Therefore, content needs to be suupported through references to the authoritative sources. Nevertheless, currently less than \textbf{a quarter} of the knowledge base(KB) statements has a reference to \textbf{non-wiki} sources and roughly an \textbf{half} of them is totally \textbf{unreferenced}.\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XX-yzT98fglAfFkHoixOI1XC1uwrS6f0u1xjdZT9TYI/edit?usp=sharing}, slides 15 to 19}
